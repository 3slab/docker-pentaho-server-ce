  <!--
    BACKLOG-20839: the karaf folder is tagged as a platform plugin in order to
    provide direct access to the VizAPI 3.0 global configuration file;
      - this was previously done another plugin (BACKLOG-14852), but PPP-3949
        removed path traversal support;
      - the direct access itself is needed because of KARAF-4723 together with
        the a karaf-tomcat bridge bug that forces a server restart when a bundle
        is updated;
      - this probably can be removed when upgrading to karaf >=4.1.
