## Welcome to the CDF API Documentation
### Some Links to Get Started

- If you're interested in details about the Dashboard objects,
  start in the {@link cdf.dashboard.Dashboard|Dashboard} class.
  From there you can jump to the specific classes and their details.

- If you want to review the methods for the base component classes, start {@link cdf.components|here}.
  This module defines the {@link cdf.components.BaseComponent|BaseComponent} class (from where all other components inherit)
  and the {@link cdf.components.UnmanagedComponent|UnmanagedComponent} (from where most of the default components inherit).
 
- If you want to know more about the component lifecycle, there's a good write up about the Unmanaged lifecycle
  {@link cdf.components.UnmanagedComponent|here}. For other documentation about the subject, in your Pentaho installation,
  navigate to Plugin Samples `->` CDF `->` Documentation `->` lifecycle
  and also Plugin Samples `->` CDF `->` Documentation `->` concepts.

- If you want to know about all existing CDF components and their properties,
  that's also available in your Pentaho installation. Navigate to Plugin Samples `->` CDF `->` Require Samples `->`
  Documentation `->` Component Reference `->` Core Components. There's a sample and a property listing for all of them there.
